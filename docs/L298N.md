# L298N Motor Driver Module

## Overview
    The L298N motor driver module consists of a L298N motor driver IC ,78M05 5V regulator, 5V jumper enable, power LED, heat sink, resistors and capacitors all combined in an integrated circuit. The diagram below shows all the components consisting inside the module.

    It is a dual channel H bridge motor driver which can be easily used to drive two motors.

    The 5V pin in this case acts as an output to power the microcontroller

    If the power supply is more than 12V, make sure the jumper is not intact and supply 5V power through the pin separately.

    |-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | VCC         | This is the pin which supplies power to the motor. It is imprinted with +12V on board but can be powered between 6-12V.                                                            |
    | Ground      | This is the common ground pin.                                                                                                                                                     |
    | 5V          | This pin supplies the power (5V) for the internal circuit (L298N IC). Will be used only if the 5V enable jumper is not intact. If jumper is intact, then it acts as an output pin. |
    | ENA         | This pin controls the speed of the motor A by enabling the PWM signal.                                                                                                             |
    | IN1 & IN2   | These are the input pins for motor A. They control the spinning direction for that particular motor.                                                                               |
    | IN3 & IN4   | These are the input pins for motor B. They control the spinning direction for that particular motor.                                                                               |
    | ENB         | This pin controls the speed of the motor B by enabling the PWM signal.                                                                                                             |
    | OUT1 & OUT2 | OUT1: Positive terminal. OUT2: Negative terminal  These are the output pins for motor A. Motor A having voltage between 5-35V, will be connected through these two terminals.      |
    | OUT3 & OUT4 | OUT3: Positive terminal OUT4: Negative terminal  These are the output pins for motor B.                                                                                            |
